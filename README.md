## Readme

### Introduction
This project looks at the conflict between Israel and Lebanon, focusing on the scale and distribution of attacks during the specified time period. The goal is to better understand where the most significant activity is happening, what kinds of attacks are most common, and the overall humanitarian impact.

### Problem to Solve
I'm trying to analyze the frequency and distribution of these attacks, the fatalities involved, and how the conflict has unfolded over time. This helps provide a clearer picture of the crisis and aids in potential response efforts.

### Data/Operation Design
- **Data Source**: The data is from ACLED, filtered for relevant events between Israel and Hezbollah.
- **Prep**: Cleaned up and grouped attacks, fatalities, and mapped locations.
- **Visuals**: 
  - A map showing attacks and fatalities by region.
  - Bar charts for top locations and attack types.
  - A line chart showing attack trends over time.

### Future Work
Iâ€™d like to add more filters, incorporate humanitarian data, and plot the route from the airport to my house in Lebanon to see how safe it would be.
